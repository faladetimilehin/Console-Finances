# Console-Finances

## Overview

This activity presents a real-world situation and i was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset file.

### User Story

```
My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
```
